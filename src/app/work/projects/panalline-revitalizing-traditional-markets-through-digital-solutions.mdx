## Overview

Panalline is a system prototype that integrates both a mobile app and website to support traditional market activities in Yogyakarta. This Android and iOS app, equipped with GPS and internet connectivity, was created to revitalize the local economy by facilitating remote purchases from traditional markets. The system not only generates income for local traders and motorcycle taxi drivers but also offers a monitoring tool for market management by local authorities.

## Key Features

- **Remote Purchases**: Enables users to purchase essential items remotely, helping maintain sales for traditional market vendors.
- **Income Generation for Drivers**: Provides a source of income for local motorcycle taxi drivers by incorporating delivery services.
- **Market Monitoring Tool**: Assists local authorities in managing and tracking market activities through a centralized dashboard.

## Technologies Used

- **Figma**: Used for UI/UX design and prototyping to ensure an intuitive and user-friendly interface across devices.

## Challenges and Learnings

A significant challenge was designing an interface that could cater to a diverse user base with varying technological familiarity. Ensuring accessibility and simplicity was crucial, especially for users less familiar with mobile apps. This project enhanced my skills in user-centric design and broadened my understanding of digital solutions for traditional markets.

## Outcome

Panalline was well-received as a solution to the economic impact of Covid-19 on traditional markets. The project concept gained recognition and appreciation at GEMASTIK XIV, underscoring its potential to support economic resilience for traditional markets and local communities.
