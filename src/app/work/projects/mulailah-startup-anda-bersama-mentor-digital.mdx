## Overview

In this project, I redesigned and developed the IBISMA website using WordPress and Elementor. Starting from the planning phase to final implementation, my goal was to create a modern, user-friendly website that improved both the visual appeal and functionality. This project involved a complete revamp of the original site to better align with the current needs of the business incubator.

## Key Features

- **Full Website Redesign**: Transformed the original website into a responsive, visually appealing site that effectively communicates the goals and offerings of IBISMA.
- **Elementor for Customization**: Leveraged Elementor’s drag-and-drop features to build custom layouts and ensure ease of maintenance and updates.
- **Improved User Experience (UX)**: Focused on creating a seamless navigation flow and enhancing accessibility for all users.

## Technologies Used

- **WordPress**: For content management and as the backbone of the website.
- **Elementor**: For building flexible, customizable pages.
- **CSS & HTML**: For additional customization and styling beyond what Elementor offers.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was the limitations imposed by using a CMS like WordPress. Customization beyond what the available themes and plugins offered wasn’t always straightforward, requiring deeper modifications and additional coding. Balancing the ease of using a CMS with the need for custom features was a learning process that helped me refine my problem-solving skills.

## Outcome

The revamped IBISMA website now offers a more intuitive and engaging user experience, with improved load times and a cohesive design. This redesign has enhanced the visibility of IBISMA’s services and streamlined the information architecture for better user navigation.
