## Overview

In this project, I designed **SocialUp**, an Android app prototype aimed at promoting social cohesion within communities. The app introduces a new approach to strengthening neighborhood bonds by leveraging monthly challenges and a community feedback system. From conception to prototype development, the focus was on improving real-world social interactions.

## Key Features

- **Neighborhood Challenge Feature**: Encourages friendly competitions between neighborhood teams with monthly challenges to foster stronger community engagement.
- **Feedback Corner**: Allows residents to provide constructive feedback directly to their local RT and RW, promoting better communication and collaboration.
- **User-Centered Design**: Ensures that the interface is intuitive, user-friendly, and accessible to all residents, regardless of their tech proficiency.

## Technologies Used

- **Figma**: For prototyping and designing the user interface.
- **Framer**: For interactive prototypes and user testing.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was designing a feature that fosters real-world engagement in an increasingly digital age. Balancing interactive app features with the goal of encouraging physical community involvement required a deep understanding of user behavior and neighborhood dynamics.

## Outcome

The app concept successfully combines digital tools with real-world engagement, providing a scalable solution to bridge the growing divide in community interactions. Early feedback highlighted the potential of this system to enhance social interaction, especially through the neighborhood challenge feature.
