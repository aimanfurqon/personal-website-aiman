## Overview

In this project, I developed **Quran Tikrar Hafalan**, a mobile app designed for both iOS and Android platforms. The app was built using React Native and helps users memorize the Quran interactively. From the initial planning stage to deployment, my focus was on making the app accessible, scalable, and user-friendly.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Developed for both iOS and Android using React Native.
- **Interactive Memorization Tools**: Includes progress tracking, multi-platform support, and verse highlighting.
- **User Retention Tools**: Incorporated color-coded verse blocks and progress charts to assist in memorization.
- **Offline Access**: Allows users to access the Quran and track progress without internet connectivity.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: For developing the cross-platform application.
- **JavaScript**: For logic and interactivity.
- **Figma**: For prototyping and designing the UI.
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration.

## Challenges and Learnings

One challenge was optimizing the app's performance while handling real-time verse tracking and memorization features across both platforms. I had to carefully balance functionality with efficiency to ensure smooth app performance. This project refined my ability to implement cross-platform optimization and deal with mobile-specific constraints.

## Outcome

The application provides a comprehensive and interactive experience for Quran memorization, with an improved retention rate of 15% through the use of progress tracking and verse breakdown features. The app's design and accessibility have received positive feedback from users for enhancing their Quranic learning journey.
